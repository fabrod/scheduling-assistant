All three proposals are different levels for the same idea in increasing difficulty.

#### 1 Basics: Calendar, Planner, Analytics
A calendar web app that you can create/edit events on through natural language processing, connected to a planner that lets you schedule daily tasks/todos that can be dragged to your weekly agenda - these can be checked complete/incomplete. Planner includes routines page that lets you include weekly, daily routines. Analytics page shows feedback on your progress, eg. how often you complete your routines/events.

I almost finished with a web development bootcamp course on Udemy. I'm using Node JS, Express, HTML/CSS/JS to build the app. I haven't decided between MongoDB or SQL yet.

#### 2 Basics + Schedule Generator
Can automatically schedule your routines around fixed events you include in your calendar (instead of having fixed, repeated events). This schedule can be regenerated or adjusted manually. Calendar learns from your adjustments to generate better schedules.

#### 3 Final app
Include all views, make easier to interact with - not fully developed yet haha

Calendar views: yearly, monthly, weekly

Planner views: monthly, weekly

Generates schedules to work towards your goals around your events
